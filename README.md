# Thesis

This Project is a lightweight physics engine for 2D games. It provides an easy-to-use interface for simulating the real-world physics of objects in a 2D game environment.

### Features

- Support for common 2D physics simulations, including gravity, momentum, and collision detection
- Flexible and customizable physics parameters, such as mass, velocity, and restitution
